  <p> Telegram bot designed publish the movie schedule of the Cineteca Nacional (Mexico) in a telegram channel in a friendly user way. Every night, CinetecaBot downloads the movie schedule for the day, including all titles, posters, descriptions and screening times. If the site is not available, it tries again in half an hour. When it has succesfully downloaded the schedule, it tailors a message for each movie and sends it to a telegram channel.
	  
Why did I create this bot? Because the Cineteca Nacional schedule site is always down when you need it </p>
