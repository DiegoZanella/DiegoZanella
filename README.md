  <H5> https://t.me/CarteleraCineteca</H5>

  <p> Telegram bot designed to publish the movie schedule of the Cineteca Nacional (Mexico) in a telegram channel in a friendly user way. Every night, CinetecaBot downloads the movie schedule for the day, including all titles, posters, descriptions and screening times. If the site is not available, it tries again in half an hour. When it has succesfully downloaded the schedule, it tailors a message for each movie and sends it to a telegram channel.
	  
Why did I create this bot? Because the Cineteca Nacional schedule site is always down when you need it </p>

  <H2> <a href="https://github.com/DiegoZanella/GovernorMexicoState2023">Electoral analysis: Governor Mexico State 2023 </a></H2>
  <p> Analysis and visualization of electoral data regarding the 2023 Mexico State election for governor.
  </p>
The goal of this project was to create a series of visualizations of the results of the election at the municipal level. These visualizations show the winner of the election at the municipal level. Another part of the series show the correlations between electoral results and demographic indicators such as margination and population size.
The databases for this project were downloaded from the Mexico State Electoral Institute (IEEM) and the Statistics and Geography National Institue (INEGI) websites. From the IEEM website I downloaded the database of the electoral results which then I cleaned using Pandas. From the INEGI website I downloaded the municipal poligons .shp files and demographic data at the municipal level. The visualizations were made using Tableau.

This is a work under progress, but you can have this preview
